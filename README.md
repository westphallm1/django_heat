## HotLoops
------------
A Django app that generates and displays simple heat engines.  
Developed on Cloud9 Online IDE and hosted at heroku: hotloops.herokuapp.com  
### About
-----------
Every time the page is loaded, a new heat cycle consisting of 4 ideal gas processes 
is computed server-side using numpy. After checking that a graph of the generated
cycle will be aesthetically pleasing (none of the processes overlap and the end points 
of each process are sufficiently far apart), a graph is generated by matplotlib. This
graph, as well as the work and heat generated by the engine at each step of the cyle, are
displayed as an image and table respectively client side. 
### Scripts
-----------
Many of the scripts in this project are auto-generated by Django. All calculations and
image generation are done by `heat/heat_cycle.py` and `heat/solve_eq.py`.
`heat/views.py` contains a small amount of code that calls on `heat_cycle` to
generate a new cycle and passes it along to Django's template function.   
The `static` directory contains the generated heat cycle plot and data table,
as well as the page's css.  
The page's html template lives in `templates/heat`
